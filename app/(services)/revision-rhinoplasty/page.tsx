          <b className="font-semibold">Revision Rhinoplasty </b>
          (Second revision rhinoplasty and Third revision rhinoplasty) is
          undoubtedly one of the most challenging surgeries performed by a
          facial plastic surgeon. Revision Rhinoplasty requires operating on a
          nose that has previously been altered surgically. This procedure
          corrects undesirable or subpar aesthetic and / or functional results
          from a Primary Rhinoplasty. In most cases, patients must wait one year
          between Primary Rhinoplasty and Revision Rhinoplasty.

          Dr. Chacra specializes in revision nose job and is highly experienced
          in this aspect of facial plastic surgery. In addition, his expertise
          in complex nasal trauma and reconstructive procedures allows him to
          rebuild the structural foundations of even the most disrupted nasal
          structures.

        <b className="font-semibold">
          A thorough nasal examination in primary cases allows Dr. Chacra to
          determine predictable patterns of anatomical variations. However, in
          Revision cases, these variations have been further altered, surgically
          resulting in a less-predictable anatomical configuration on which the
          surgeon must operate. Thus, due to the extremely sensitive and
          detail-oriented nature of this procedure, it is crucial to carefully
          navigate and tailor each revision case with the utmost care and
          planning.

          What is the most common reason for Revision Rhinoplasty?

        <p>
          Patients often come to Dr. Chacra for Revision Rhinoplasty because
