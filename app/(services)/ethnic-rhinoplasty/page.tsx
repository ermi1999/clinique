        <ItalicHeader>ETHNIC RHINOPLASTY</ItalicHeader>
        <p>
          <b className="text-black font-semibold">Ethnic Rhinoplasty</b> refers
          to surgery designed for non-white patients. This term encompasses a
          wide range of ethnicities, from Asian to Middle Eastern, to African,
          Afro-American and Hispanic. Although the skills required to perform
          all Rhinoplasty are the same, the goals can be different when it comes
          to Ethnic Rhinoplasty.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all Rhinoplasty, the main goal of this procedure is to enhance a
          patient’s natural nose shape. However, preserving the ethnic qualities
          of patients’ facial features and characteristics is also important to
          Dr. Chacra when it comes to these types of procedures.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of surgery can vary greatly from the widely known
          traditional Rhinoplasty in Caucasian patients. Some examples of
          anatomical variations we see when it comes to different noses from
          around the world include:
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <strong className="text-black">
          Differences in the thickness and complexity of the skin, as well as
          variations in size, shape and orientation of the nasal cartilage and
          bone.{" "}
          <i>
            Is it the specific and innumerable combination of these anatomical
            differences that accounts for the uniqueness of each nose.
          </i>
          <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          This niche area of specialization requires both an understanding of
          culture, as well as different concepts of beauty throughout the world.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethnic Rhinoplasty can involve the addition of cartilage to create
          structure for patients who are looking to correct a flattened nose,
          flaring nostrils or other ethnic characteristics.
          <br />

          Dr. Chacra uses augmentation techniques that utilize almost
          exclusively natural tissues when possible and / or medical-grade
          implants to produce noses that match the shape of each patient’s face
          while maintaining the unique beauty of their heritage and enhancing
          facial harmony. <br />
          <br />

        <p>
          Dr. Chacra is a Nasal Specialist. His extensive knowledge of nasal
          anatomy allows him to carefully analyze facial variations that are
          ethnic-specific and then tailor a treatment plan that is unique to
          each patient.

          He completed his fellowship in Houston, Texas, where he had the
          opportunity to operate on African American and Hispanic American
          patients often. Like Texas, Montreal’s population is made up of a rich
          cultural mosaic, allowing Dr. Chacra to cater to patients from all
          over the world, right at home.

        <ItalicHeader>ASIAN RHINOPLASTY</ItalicHeader>
        <p>
          Many patients from Asian cultures (Japan, China, Philippines, Vietnam,
          Cambodia, Malaysia, Korea) seek to enhance their nasal bridge through
          Rhinoplasty. A flat or undefined nasal bridge can be redefined using a
          cartilage graft harvested from the nose or another area of the body
          such as the ear or rib.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Some patients of Asian descent are also concerned with nostril shape
          or size. <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra can alter the size or shape of the nostrils or nasal tip to
          complement patients’ features. During Asian Rhinoplasty, changes that
          match the proportions of patients’ features are made while respecting
          the unique characteristics of their background.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <ItalicHeader>MIDDLE EASTERN RHINOPLASTY</ItalicHeader>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra is also attuned to the unique needs of Syrian, Persian,
          Egyptian, Algerian, Lebanese, and other Middle Eastern patients. A
          drooping tip can be elevated or even reduced while respecting the
          natural attractiveness of these patients’ cultural heritage.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a prominent or deviated nasal bridge can be reduced or
          straightened with minute changes that improve the overall size and
          shape of a patient’s nose in a Custom Nose Reshaping Surgery.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Our patients’ Middle Eastern heritage is still evident
          post-operatively; however, they achieve greater harmony and balance
          among their facial features through this type of Rhinoplasty.

        <ItalicHeader>AFRICAN AMERICAN RHINOPLASTY</ItalicHeader>
        <p>
          People of African American descent may also seek Rhinoplasty to
          correct Functional and / or Cosmetic imperfections. Common concerns
          for these patients may include a wide or rounded tip, large bridge of
          the nose or enlarged nostrils.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          These issues can be addressed during your Consultation with Dr.
          Chacra.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Honoring our patients’ heritage and achieving facial harmony (while
          softening the appearance of the nose) remain the aesthetic goals of
          this procedure.

        <ItalicHeader>OTHER TYPES OF ETHNIC RHINOPLASTY</ItalicHeader>
        <p>
          Many ethnicities have inherited unique features that have been passed
          down through generations. Typically, people are proud and feel
          connected to their heritage, which links them to a rich culture.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          During our Consultation Process, we discuss a spectrum of
          transformation, whereby patients are invited to envision their desired
          outcome(s) on that spectrum.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of our patients seek to alter their appearance (for a variety of
          personal reasons) and wish to present themselves to the world in a way
          that better reflects how they feel about themselves.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          What can you expect during an Ethnic Rhinoplasty Consultation?
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra will listen to your concerns, expectations and desires
          surrounding the outcome of your surgery while maintaining ethical and
          realistic practice standards.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          In today’s world, and in cities like Montreal, surgeons are more
          frequently encountering patients who are from a varied mix of ethnic
          backgrounds. This cultural mosaic makes for fascinating conversations
          and cases when it comes to Rhinoplasty.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The blends and variations of skin types and anatomical distinctions
          make for interesting, and sometimes complex cases which require a
          certain level of finesse, attention to detail and knowledge to achieve
          both a polished and personalized result. Dr. Chacra has developed a
          keen eye for functional and aesthetic Rhinoplasty solutions to
          treating patients whose ethnic backgrounds may pose an extra
          challenge.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          When operating on patients who have mixed ethnicities, it is important
          to consider the unique features of each ethnicity, and how they
          interact with one another to achieve a harmonious result. This
          requires a nuanced understanding of nasal anatomy, and a personalized
          approach to each patient’s individual needs.
