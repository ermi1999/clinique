          Chin Augmentation can be performed in combination with Rhinoplasty.
          When a chin is small, the nose often appears proportionately bigger.
          By virtue of augmenting the chin, the appearance of the nose is
          softened. Chin Augmentation produces subtle changes to the face that
          can greatly improve a patient’s overall appearance and enhance their
          confidence. The goal of a Chin Augmentation is to provide the patient
          with a balanced, harmonious, and more defined chin, jawline, and
          profile.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Chin Implant Surgery is designed to refine the appearance and increase
          the size of the chin.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          It can also refine the neck and jawline while recontouring the area.
          During this procedure, silicone implants that have been altered
          specifically for each patient are placed atop of their natural bone
          structure in the chin.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra’s approach when it comes to Chin Augmentation is to create
          a balanced definition.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          By delicately recontouring a patient’s facial structure, he provides
          his patients with an enhanced, more aesthetic profile.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Patients may experience subtle or dramatic changes to their profile
          depending on the size and shape of the Chin Implant that Dr. Chacra
          deems the most appropriate for their face.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          At Clinique 7, we believe that these changes are meant to be both
          natural and virtually undetectable.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          A successful Chin Augmentation will highlight surrounding features,
          such as a patient’s eyes or lips. Dr. Chacra strives to provide his
          patients with the most natural look possible, unless they are seeking
          a more dramatic result, in which case he can personalize their
          surgical plan accordingly during the Consultation Process.

          PROCESS <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          During a Chin Augmentation, a small incision is made directly under
          the chin. <br /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra carefully creates a tight pocket where he secures the
          customized silicone implant in place. The implant is sutured to the
          deeper tissues within the chin to avoid shifting and moving.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <strong className="font-semibold text-black">
          SIZING <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra first performs an in-depth analysis as to the unique facial
          anatomy of each patient. This includes the structure of the chin
          itself, as well as the nose, and the rest of the face.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any cosmetic surgery, patients’ personal desires are always
          taken into consideration. Computer imaging software enables us to
          share a preview of your potential results, whereby you can visualize
          what different size implants may look like. <br />
          During this thorough examination, Dr. Chacra will establish the degree
          of desired projection that will best suit the patient’s facial shape
          and profile.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          After a detailed discussion about the procedure, Dr. Chacra will
          select an implant size that will best compliment your facial features.
          Generally, the smaller the chin, the larger the implant will have to
          be to provide adequate projection.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The chosen incision method and placement of the implant is also a
          custom approach. All these components come together to ensure natural
          results.

          MATERIALS <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          Chin implants are typically made of silicone or other biocompatible
          materials. <br />
          Dr. Chacra prefers to work with what is called a Rigid Silicone
          Implant because they achieve optimal recontouring results.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Chin Augmentation is designed to enhance the contour of the chin.
          Rigid Silicone Implants allow for tissue growth and prevent shifting
          of the implant.
          <br />

        <strong className="font-semibold text-black">
          SAFETY <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          Chin Implants are considered safe when performed by an experienced,
          board-certified surgeon. Dr. Chacra values safety and ethics and uses
          only the most advanced materials and state-of-the-art placement
          techniques.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedures we offer at Clinique 7 are performed with the utmost
          care and consideration.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra is always abreast of new developments as far as the
          treatments we offer to ensure the highest standard of quality, care,
          and vigilance when it comes to his patients and their results.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, after about two weeks, the implant will be stable and sit
          in its permanent position.
          <br /> <br />

          CANDIDACY <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          Patients who present with a recessed chin, or what’s referred to as a
          “weak chin” are good candidates for this procedure. Dr. Chacra’s
          ability to blend facial enhancements with the rest of the face ensures
          that patients achieve the most balanced facial proportions possible.

          RESULTS <br />
          <br />
        </strong>
        <p>
          Although the change is immediate, the final results can only be
          perceived once the healing process has ended, approximately 6 weeks
          post-op. Patients usually experience temporary swelling and moderate
          bruising or tenderness in the chin area which subsides within the
          first couple of days following surgery.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Patients are usually able to resume daily activities and go back to
          work after 1 week.

        <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
          <li>
            Superb, natural results that last a lifetime when performed
            properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            A more projected chin allows for enhanced balance between the upper
            and lower parts of the face. An undefined or “weak” (receding) chin
            may suggest a timid presence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chin Implants add volume and shape to the chin, creating balanced
            definition with the rest of your features. This procedure breeds a
            high level of satisfaction with little pain or downtime.
          </li>
          <li>
            More defined facial contours often make patients feel and appear
            more confident than someone with an underdeveloped chin. Although a
            single feature does not create natural harmony when it comes to the
            face, enhancing the structure of the chin can lead to a more
            attractive face.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <br />
          Meticulously chosen by Dr. Chacra, a high-quality Chin Augmentation is
          not only undetectable, but truly mimics the appearance and feel of
          natural bone and tissue.

        <Heading className="underline">CHIN LIPOSUCTION</Heading>
        <p>
          <br />
          Chin Liposuction, also known as Submental Liposuction, is a cosmetic
          surgery that allows the surgeon to remove excess fat from beneath the
          chin.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chacra uses only the safest and most advanced techniques to create
          defined, natural contours along the neck and jawline. This procedure
          is performed on the same day as a patient’s Rhinoplasty, just as a
          Chin Implant would.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a Chin Implant, however, Chin Liposuction is a reductive
          procedure.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          While the patient is under anesthesia, a cannula (very thin metal
          tube) is used to carefully suction out excess fat from the chin.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this procedure is quick, it still requires skill and
          gentleness.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          As with all our surgeries, Chin Liposuction does not generally produce
          any noticeable scarring.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the incisions are closed, a chin strap garment is fitted. To
          ensure optimal results, it is required that patients wear it for a few
          days during the post-operative period. Compression garments are
          intended to minimize bruising and control drainage following surgery.

        <p>
          Following Chin Liposuction, patients usually experience some mild
          discomfort that is alleviated by prescribed pain medication. Work may
          be resumed after only a few days, or up to a week. Generally, this is
          a very swift and simple surgery to recover from.

          Most patients see a noticeable change after 1 week, with gradual
          improvement over the course of 3 weeks. The swelling is more
          significant as it is a “soft” area of the face.
